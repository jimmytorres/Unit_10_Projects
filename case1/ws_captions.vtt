00:01.000 --> 00:04.000 
We observe today

caption2
00:04.000 --> 00:06.000 
not a victory of party, 

caption3 
00:06.000 --> 00:10.000 
but a celebration of freedom-

caption4
00:10.000 --> 00:12.000 
symbolizing an end,

caption5
00:12.000 --> 00:15.000 
as well as a beginning- 

caption6
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000 
signifying renewal, 

caption7
00:17.000 --> 00:19.000 
as well as change.

caption8
00:19.000 --> 00:22.000 
 For all I have sworn before you 

caption9
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000 
and Almighty God 

caption10
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000 
the same solemn oath 

caption11
00:27.000 --> 00:30.000 
our forebears prescribed  

caption12
00:30.000 --> 00:33.000 
nearly a century and three-quaters ago.
